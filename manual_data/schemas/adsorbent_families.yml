description: >
  Definition of major adsorbent material families and their core CO2 capture
  mechanisms. Used as a lookup table for categorizing materials in the database.

columns:
- name: id
  definition: Unique integer identifier for the adsorbent family.
  format: integer
  primary_key: true
  required: true
  examples:
  - 1
  - 4
  - 7

- name: family_name
  definition: Name of the adsorbent family category.
  format: string
  required: true
  unique: true
  examples:
  - Zeolites
  - MOFs
  - Porous carbons
  - Solid amines
  - COFs

- name: inclusion
  definition: Criteria describing what types of materials belong to this family.
  format: string
  required: false
  examples:
  - "Zeolites + zeotypes (e.g., 13X, 5A, cation-exchanged zeolites)"
  - "Metal-organic frameworks / porous coordination polymers"
  - "Amine-impregnated, amine-grafted, amine resins (ion-exchange style)"

- name: core_capture_mode
  definition: Primary mechanism for CO2 capture used by materials in this family.
  format: string
  required: false
  allowed_values:
  - Physisorption
  - Chemisorption
  - Physisorption (electrostatic)
  - Physisorption (tunable sites)
  - Mostly physisorption
  - Mostly physisorption (functionalizable)
  - Mostly physisorption / tailored interactions
  - Strong adsorption / chemisorption
  - Chemisorption (high-T looping)
  - N/A (not a sorbent)
  examples:
  - "Physisorption (electrostatic)"
  - "Chemisorption"
  - "Mostly physisorption (tunable sites)"

instructions:
  usage: >
    This table serves as a lookup/reference for the family_categorization table.
    Each material in family_categorization references a family_id from this table.
  extensibility: >
    New families can be added as needed. Ensure the core_capture_mode accurately
    reflects the dominant CO2 binding mechanism for the family.
