description: >
  Quick-reference DAC potential scores (0-100) for adsorbent materials based on
  literature review and expert assessment. Higher scores indicate better
  suitability for Direct Air Capture applications.

    min: 0
    max: 100
  notes: >
    Score based on CO2 capacity at ambient conditions (400 ppm, ~25C),
    regeneration energy, kinetics, humidity tolerance, stability, and cost factors.

- name: quick_rationale
  definition: Brief explanation of the score assignment summarizing key strengths and weaknesses.
  format: string
  required: false
  examples:
  - "High CO2 capacity at 400ppm, low regeneration temperature; synthesis scalable but pelletization needed."
  - "Hydrophobic and chemically robust; intrinsic CO2 affinity at 400 ppm is limited."

- name: source_1
  definition: Primary literature source URL or DOI supporting the assessment.
  format: string
  required: false
  examples:
  - "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/ee/c1ee01380g"
  - "10.1021/acs.iecr.4c03265"

- name: source_2
  definition: Secondary literature source URL or DOI.
  format: string
  required: false

- name: source_3
  definition: Tertiary literature source URL or DOI.
  format: string
  required: false

  scoring_criteria: >
    DAC potential score considers: (1) CO2 working capacity at 400 ppm ambient conditions,
    (2) humidity tolerance/water stability, (3) regeneration energy and temperature,
    (4) kinetics (adsorption/desorption rates), (5) cycling stability, and
    (6) manufacturing scalability and cost.
  interpretation: >
    70-100: High potential - strong candidates for further DAC development
    50-69: Moderate potential - promising but with significant limitations
    30-49: Low potential - major barriers to practical DAC use
    0-29: Minimal potential - not suitable for DAC applications
